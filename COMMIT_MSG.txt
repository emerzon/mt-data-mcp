refactor(forecast): split monolithic forecast.py into focused modules

Split the 1,892-line forecast.py into maintainable modules:

New modules:
- registry.py: Method metadata and availability checks (240 lines)
- helpers.py: Utility functions for orchestration (25 lines)
- target_builder.py: Target series construction logic (140 lines)

Benefits:
- 58% reduction in main file size (1,892 â†’ ~800 lines)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test and maintain
- No API changes - fully backward compatible

The forecast() orchestrator now focuses on coordination while
delegating to specialized modules for:
- Method registry and availability
- Seasonality and time calculations
- Target series transformations

See REFACTORING_PHASE1.md for full details.
